### About project
The project is at the very beginning of development. You can find API here https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/websocket/ Maybe later it will become a library or it will allow plugins to be connected here.

### Thanks
The original idea was taken from the project https://github.com/APayerl/HomeAssistantWS (Java)
